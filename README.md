# **NakedPolicy**

### *Privacy Policies. Terms. Cookies. Simplified.*

NakedPolicy is an intelligent browser extension that breaks down complex legal documents — privacy policies, terms & conditions, cookie notices, and codes of conduct — into simple, human-friendly summaries.

Modern digital platforms bury users under pages of legal jargon. NakedPolicy cuts through the noise and gives you instant clarity, one line at a time.

---

## **The Problem It Solves**

Every day, millions of users blindly click **“Accept”** without understanding what they’re agreeing to.
Privacy policies and terms are intentionally:

* Long
* Confusing
* Packed with legal and technical jargon

Because of this, users rarely know:

* **What personal data is collected**
* **How it’s used or shared**
* **How long it’s stored**
* **What rights they actually have**
* **What cookies and trackers are running in the background**

This lack of transparency puts people at risk of **unwanted tracking, data misuse, and unfair terms**.

## **How NakedPolicy Helps**

NakedPolicy brings transparency to the digital world with:

### **One-Line Legal Summaries**

Transforms lengthy, complex documents into short, digestible insights — section by section.

### **Clarity on Data Collection**

Shows exactly **what data is being collected**, **how it’s used**, and **who it’s shared with**.

### **Simple Cookie Explanations**

Explains tracking technologies in plain language — no tech background required.

### **Instant, Informed Consent**

Helps users make smart privacy decisions *before* clicking “Accept”.
